This research leverages Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) to identify and analyze the key predictors of student performance, such as study habits, sleep patterns, extracurricular engagement, and academic history. By quantifying the relationship between these diverse variables and final outcomes, the project provides a data-driven framework for educational institutions to pinpoint at-risk students and implement targeted interventions. Ultimately, the model serves as a strategic tool for optimizing teaching methodologies and enhancing the overall learning environment through predictive analytics.
